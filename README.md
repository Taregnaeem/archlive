## Naming My OS

Such A Pain __ __ #@$$... So, first i though - "ARCH3", coz it's arch and use i3 as WM... NO!!! coz i is missing... <br />

Alright, How about - "Archy", Coz arch+i = archy... NO!!! Weird. <br />

Whatever... it's just *"ARCHLIVE"* <br />

## Few Points

- As it says *"LIVE"*... which means it can only run live (at least for now) coz i did not made any installer for it yet. <br />
- You need to read the i3 configs to fully operate it, like keybindings, windows tiling, etc. <br />
- You may need to modify polybar configs, like The BAT0 to BAT1 / wlan0 to wlp3s0... stuff like that. <br />
- I built it on a machine with intel pentium cpu & intel HD gpu so it have the intel video drivers. <br />
- There is only one person behind all this- ME, So appreciate it. it maybe not perfect or may not run on your machine. <br />
- This OS may not be for people who are beginners to linux, however i tried my best to make it simple and easy. <br />
- Well, That's it for now... try it, have fun. <br />
